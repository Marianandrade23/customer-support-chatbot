This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). his project was created as part of the Headstarter Fellowship by Dana Altier & Mariana Andrade.

## Getting Started

1. Clone git repository

```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/DAltier/customer-support-ai.git
```

2. Install Packages (If have not)

```bash
    $ npm install
```

3. Add your OpenAI key by creating your own `.env.local` file in the root directory

```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openAI_apikey
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
